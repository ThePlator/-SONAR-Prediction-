# SONAR_Prediction
## 📌 Project Overview

The SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project is a machine learning model that classifies objects as either rock or mine based on sonar signals. This classification is particularly useful in underwater object detection and naval applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing and feature extraction from SONAR dataset
- Training multiple machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Deployment-ready with a user-friendly interface

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the SONAR dataset, which contains 208 observations with 60 numerical features representing sonar readings. The target variable classifies objects as either Rock (R) or Mine (M).

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook for development & analysis
